 <h1>SALO</h1>
 <h3>Informaton about SALO</h3>
 <p>SALO is eaten fresh, salted, smoked, boiled, stewed or fried. For the name of cooked (salted or salted-smoked) subcutaneous lard sometimes use the borrowed word "lard" - from the German Speck, but in common use such a product is often called salted or smoked lard.
    SALO with large and numerous meat veins is called "peritoneum", in salted form - the Russian word "brisket" or English "bacon".
    Small fried pieces of SALO are called "cracklings".
    Ghee is called "lard" and is used as cooking fat, and in European countries - also as a spread for sandwiches (often with the addition of onions, apples, greens, etc.). Rendered animal fat can also be used for technical purposes - for example, as a lubricant (the names "cannon fat", "pussalo" have now switched to oil-based lubricant) and for the manufacture of soap. In the United States, beef fat waste is processed into fuel.</p>
