<h1>GORILKA</h1>

<h3>The origin of the name</h3>
<p>The origin of the word "gorilka" is associated with the word "burn". Most likely, the name comes from the fact that in the manufacture of gorilka one of the indicators of its strength is the control by igniting the test portion. If the alcohol content is sufficient, the liquid is engaged in a bluish or greenish (when there is the presence of copper hydroxide) flame, and if the C2H5OH content is too low - combustion does not occur at all.
    Because of the ability of strong drinks to burn, the American Indians called all strong alcoholic beverages "fire water". A similar origin of the names of gorilka in German and Polish - Brantwein and Gozhalka. In the Muscovite documents of 1653 the Russian is mentioned. "Hot wine", ie one that burns.

    In Russian, gorilka is called "vodka". However, in ancient times the word "gorilka" did not mean an alcoholic beverage for intoxication, but a tincture of medicinal herbs for external and internal use. vodkas differed in the direction of therapeutic action: Russian. "Gastric vodka", "lung vodka", "heart vodka". Doses did not exceed half a spoon</p>
